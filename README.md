# designPatterns

## Factory 

```
designpatterns\factory_videoExporter
```
An example of what the Factory pattern (or: Abstract Factory) is in Python. One of the greatest things of this pattern is that it allows you to separate creation from use. It's one of my most-used patterns.

The example used is a video and audio exporter (low, high or master quality).

* Code without factory :
```
designpatterns\factory_videoExporter\without_factory.py
```
* The same script improve with the factory pattern :
```
designpatterns\factory_videoExporter\main.py
```
